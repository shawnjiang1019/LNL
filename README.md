🌟 Inspiration

We're inspired by the idea that emotions run deeper than a simple 'sad' or 'uplifting.' Our project was born from the realization that personalization is the key to managing emotional states effectively.
🤯🔍 What it does?

Our solution is an innovative platform that harnesses the power of AI and emotion recognition to create personalized Spotify playlists. It begins by analyzing a user's emotions, both from facial expressions and text input, to understand their current state of mind. We then use this emotional data, along with the user's music preferences, to curate a Spotify playlist that's tailored to their unique emotional needs.

What sets our solution apart is its ability to go beyond simplistic mood categorizations like 'happy' or 'sad.' We understand that emotions are nuanced, and our deep-thought algorithms ensure that the playlist doesn't worsen the user's emotional state but, rather, optimizes it. This means the music is not just a random collection; it's a therapeutic selection that can help users manage their emotions more effectively.

It's music therapy reimagined for the digital age, offering a new and more profound dimension in emotional support.
💡🛠💎 How we built it?

We crafted our project by combining advanced technologies and teamwork. We used Flask, Python, React, and TypeScript for the backend and frontend, alongside the Spotify and OpenAI APIs.

Our biggest challenge was integrating the Spotify API. When we faced issues with an existing wrapper, we created a custom solution to overcome the hurdle.

Throughout the process, our close collaboration allowed us to seamlessly blend emotion recognition, music curation, and user-friendly design, resulting in a platform that enhances emotional well-being through personalized music.
